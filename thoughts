Overall:
  I want to use as little javascript as possible in order to keep effects the same
  when the user has javascript turned off. 

About:

  I want to do something dramatically different with the about page. I would prefer
    for this to be the main page. It will be the page with the logo that pops out a 
    lot more that the rest of the site. The actual layout is mocked in the sketch 
    project. It should be super simple but able to stand on it's own in terms of 
    technique.

    For example: 
      - When the page is entered, It will state my name using a typing affect. 
      - Main Logo
        - {On Scroll} the main logo will position itself to the left of the page.
        - {On Click}  the main logo will transition into/out-of the site navigation bar
          - This feature is Exclusive to the About page

Projects: 
  
  * Maybe this should be a page of my interactions on social media??? My quora answers,
      Tweets, Blog posts, Medium articles, Github pushes *

  I'm not even sure if this page will exist. At least not off the bat. It's purpose is
    pretty self explanitory


Blog: 
  
  One of the pages I'm more excited about. This page should contain some of my musings.
    I'm still not sure how i'll add posts to this page. I'd rather not do it manually but
    I'll wait until the actual implementation in rails to decide this. I'll most likely 
    create a page or url that only I know and tie that into my blog list/cms.

Resume: 

  I can get really creative with this. I'd mainly use it as a place to post where I've 
    worked and what I've done, and education. I could also create a printer friendly 
    option using css. Omit all of the super unimportant information and styling.
